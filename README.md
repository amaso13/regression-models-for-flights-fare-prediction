# regression-models-for-flights-fare-prediction

# Project Overview

Airlines flights tickets are constantly changing and depend on several factors. These factors include destinations, route, duration, stops. This project aims to evaluate different regression models and identify the best model for predicting flight fares.

We started with getting some initial libraries, then moved on to pre-processing and feature engineering to extract meaningful features, outliers detection, feature selection and models building, hyperparameter tuning. We conclude by comparing the different scores of the models.
