# Project Overview
We started with getting some initial libraries, then moved on to pre-processing and feature engineering to extract meaningful features, outliers detection, feature selection and models building, hyperparameter tuning. We conclude by comparing the different scores of the models.

- Data pre-processing
- Outlier detection
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model building
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Models comparison
